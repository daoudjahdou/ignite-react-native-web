Ignite for React-based Single Page Web Apps

#### Why?

 * you shouldn't need to be Superman (or Wonderwoman) to write a web app these days.
 * its fun to share stuff (but perhaps not toothbrushes)
 * I like to give back.

## Warning!!!!
Warning! Warning! ~~Beta~~ Alpha Software, `0.2.0` release, breaking changes, frequent crashes, lots of bugs, all that stuff. Might not work in your use case, but I'm pretty sure it [WOMM](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=WOMM). Having said this though, the component/container generators and basic structure of the project should be sound.

Still here? Cool.

Here are some instructions to get you started:

- Install the ignite cli, if you haven't done so already - `npm install -g ignite-cli`
  - ProTip: That'll require you to install the `react-native-cli` too, but we'll be taking that away (hopefully soon!)
- Run the following command - `ignite new MyAwesomeThing -b ignite-react-native-web`
  - ProTip: the -b switch means "Use this boilerplate"
- Thats it. Really.

This repo makes no assumptions about your component library, so you can install whatever you like (or none at all).

### Driving it :car:
You can use the following commands:

```
Type ignite generate ________ to run one of these generators:

  component   Generates a component and styles.
  container   Generates a redux smart component.
  crudsaga    Generates a saga.
  crudredux   Generates a action/creator/reducer set for Redux.
  saga        Generates a saga
  redux       Generates a action/creator/reducer set for Redux.
  screen      Generates a redux smart component.
```

### Things you'll need to do yourself
Yeah, you can't have everything :).
 - When you do api calls for realsies, you'll need to hook up the saga index file [file](https://github.com/juddey/ignite-react-native-web/blob/master/boilerplate/src/Sagas/index.js)


### Tests
  add `tests: true` to your `ignite.json` and watch jest tests magically appear for everything (except screens) when you run the generators.

### StoryBooks
  add `storybooks: true` to your `ignite.json` and watch storybook templates get generated automagically for each of your components. `yarn run storybook` will start the storybook server on port `9009`.

### Don't like my templates?
Hey, that's cool. I don't mind. All I wanted was to get you started quickly, and help you avoid some of the pain I went through when setting up my projects. Feel free to `ignite spork` and follow your :nose:.

### TODO
- [ ] Add `contributing.md`
- [x] Add testing with jest. Coming Soon!. :)
- [x] Write some integration tests. No, really. :)
- [x] Add a proper boilerplate for ~~both~~ web ~~and electron~~ projects
- [ ] Uninstall. Although, I am not sure why you'd want to leave.
- [x] Live long and prosper. ðŸ––

### Thanks :heart: :clap:
